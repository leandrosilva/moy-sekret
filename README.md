Playing around with cryptography using [sodiumoxide](https://github.com/sodiumoxide/sodiumoxide), Rust bindings to [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/).

Sodium is a modern, easy-to-use software library for encryption, decryption, signatures, password hashing and more.

It is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of [NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/), with a compatible API, and an extended API to improve usability even further.

Its goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.

Early, early, stage yet.
