Playing around with cryptography using [sodiumoxide](https://github.com/sodiumoxide/sodiumoxide), Rust bindings to [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/).

Sodium is a modern, easy-to-use software library for encryption, decryption, signatures, password hashing and more.

It is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of [NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/), with a compatible API, and an extended API to improve usability even further.

Its goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.

## Status

Early, early stage. Yet functional.

As a prove of concept to something bigger and more elaborate than that, it works just fine. It goes through the happy paths and a few corner cases too.

To work on test cases now.
